# FAQ
**Where can I download Sentinel?**  
Click the [Releases](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Sentinel/releases) tab at the top to download the latest version.

**Is this approved by Riot?**  
TL; DR: You won't get banned for using Sentinel.  

[As per Riot's third-party guidelines](https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/225266848), this program does not give you an inherent advantage or interacts with the League game client in any way. As such, you won't be banned for using this tool, but Riot reserves the right to break it at any time. See [this post on Reddit by Riot Sargonas](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/80d4r0/runebook_the_ultimate_rune_pages_manager_that_you/duv2r22/) for more context on how Riot treats programs like this one.

**How do I uninstall?**  
Click on the Sentinel icon to open the settings, then click the Uninstall button. Easy as pie!

**Wow this is amazing! Do you have any other cool programs?**  
_shameless plug start_   
As a matter of fact I do! I created [Mimic](http://mimic.molenzwiebel.xyz/desktop), which is a client on your mobile phone. I also created [Deceive](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Deceive), which allows you to appear offline to all your friends.
